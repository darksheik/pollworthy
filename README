A test:
Create a web application with the Grails framework, available at http://grails.org, that meets the following requirements:

    a visitor can create a poll, where a poll consists of a question and a number of options (only one option can be selected at a time)
    a visitor can see view and vote on other polls
    a visitor can view poll results before or after voting
    a visitor can leave a comment about a poll
    there is some mechanism for users to log in (anonymous users can still view all data and comment on a poll, but not vote)
    on initialization, the application is automatically populated with sample data
    static page loads are minimized using AJAX techniques
    do not use Grailsâ€™ scaffolding

After completing the above tasks, package up the entire project directory in a .zip file. Create a webcast/screen recording demonstrating the functionality of the project.

Classes:
